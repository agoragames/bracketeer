load Empty BracketTree
render base match ( see bracket\_tree.renderer for setup)
header information
Bootstrap for easy nav additions (configure tomorrow)


Why the hell can I never rememer bootstrap classes? (or type for that matter)

Re-use rendering...I don't want to redo everything in the rendering options


YAY TWEETS. @cadwallion :D

IDs aren't overlapping, yet exit() is not being triggered.  Why?

remove is being called on the group, based on the data, so why wouldn't that
apply to the g.node once the data that drives them is expired?

getting called 8 times, with 3 repeats: the original 3 nodes not disappearing,
then a full runthrough.  This makes no sense, and stabbings sound like a good
thing right now.
